## How JavaScript works

- JavaScript is a single-threaded language and executes code synchronously by default.

- This means it can execute only one line of code at a time, in a specific order.

- Everything in JavaScript happens inside an Execution Context.

- An Execution Context has two parts:
  
  1. Memory Component (Variable Environment)
     - Stores variables and their values
     - Stores function declarations with their complete code
  
  2. Code Component (Thread of Execution)
     - Executes the code line by line

## How JavaScript Code Is Executed

Everything in JavaScript is executed inside an **execution context**.

**Global Execution Context (GEC)**

- When a JavaScript program starts, a **Global Execution Context (GEC)** is created.
- The GEC is pushed onto the **call stack**.
- All JavaScript code runs inside an execution context.

**Phases of Execution Context**

Each execution context goes through **two phases**:

1. **Memory Creation Phase**
2. **Code Execution Phase**

**Memory Creation Phase**
- JavaScript scans the entire code before execution.
- Memory is allocated for variables and functions.
- During this phase:
  - Variables are assigned a placeholder value of `undefined`.
  - Functions are stored in memory with their complete code.
- No code is executed in this phase.

**Code Execution Phase**
- JavaScript executes the code **line by line**.
- Values are assigned to variables.
- Calculations and operations are performed.
- The actual execution of the program happens in this phase.

**Function Execution**

- When JavaScript encounters a **function call**, it creates a new execution context for that function.
- This new execution context is pushed onto the **call stack**.
- The function execution context also goes through:
  - Memory Creation Phase
  - Code Execution Phase
- If JavaScript encounters a `return` statement:
  - The function’s execution context is removed (popped) from the call stack.
  - Control returns to the place where the function was called, along with the returned value.

**Call Stack**

- The **call stack** manages the order of execution of execution contexts.
- It follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle.
- When a function finishes execution, its execution context is popped from the stack.
- After the entire program finishes execution:
  - The Global Execution Context is popped off the call stack.
- This marks the end of JavaScript program execution.
